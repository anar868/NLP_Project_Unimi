      "Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) researchers play an important role in the ethics and governance of AI, including through their work, advocacy, and choice of employment. Nevertheless, this influential group's attitudes are not well understood, undermining our ability to discern consensuses or disagreements between AI/ML researchers. To examine these researchers' views, we conducted a survey of those who published in two top AI/ML conferences (N = 524). We compare these results with those from a 2016 survey of AI/ML researchers (Grace et al., 2018) and a 2018 survey of the US public (Zhang & Dafoe, 2020). We find that AI/ML researchers place high levels of trust in international organizations and scientific organizations to shape the development and use of AI in the public interest; moderate trust in most Western tech companies; and low trust in national militaries, Chinese tech companies, and Facebook. While the respondents were overwhelmingly opposed to AI/ML researchers working on lethal autonomous weapons, they are less opposed to researchers working on other military applications of AI, particularly logistics algorithms. A strong majority of respondents think that AI safety research should be prioritized and that ML institutions should conduct pre-publication review to assess potential harms. Being closer to the technology itself, AI/ML researchers are well placed to highlight new risks and develop technical solutions, so this novel attempt to measure their attitudes has broad relevance. The findings should help to improve how researchers, private sector executives, and policymakers think about regulations, governance frameworks, guiding principles, and national and international governance strategies for AI.

      "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is at a crucial point in its development: stable enough to be used in production systems, and increasingly pervasive in our lives. What does that mean for its safety? In his book Normal Accidents, the sociologist Charles Perrow proposed a framework to analyze new technologies and the risks they entail. He showed that major accidents are nearly unavoidable in complex systems with tightly coupled components if they are run long enough. In this essay, we apply and extend Perrow’s framework to AI to assess its potential risks. Today’s AI systems are already highly complex, and their complexity is steadily increasing. As they become more ubiquitous, different algorithms will interact directly, leading to tightly coupled systems whose capacity to cause harm we will be unable to predict. We argue that under the current paradigm, Perrow’s normal accidents apply to AI systems and it is only a matter of time before one occurs. This article appears in the AI & Society track.\n",
      "We present a novel approach for decreasing state uncertainty in planning prior to solving the planning problem. This is done by making predictions about the state based on currently known information, using machine learning techniques. For domains where uncertainty is high, we define an active learning process for identifying which information, once sensed, will best improve the accuracy of predictions. We demonstrate that an agent is able to solve problems with uncertainties in the state with less planning effort compared to standard planning techniques. Moreover, agents can solve problems for which they could not find valid plans without using predictions. Experimental results also demonstrate that using our active learning process for identifying information to be sensed leads to gathering information that improves the prediction process.\n",
      "This article describes REBA, a knowledge representation and reasoning architecture for robots that is based on tightly-coupled transition diagrams of the domain at two different levels of granularity. An action language is extended to support non-boolean fluents and non-deterministic causal laws, and used to describe the domain's transition diagrams, with the fine-resolution transition diagram being defined as a refinement of the coarse-resolution transition diagram. The coarse-resolution system description, and a history that includes prioritized defaults, are translated into an Answer Set Prolog (ASP) program. For any given goal, inference in the ASP program provides a plan of abstract actions. To implement each such abstract action, the robot automatically zooms to the part of the fine-resolution transition diagram relevant to this action. The zoomed fine-resolution system description, and a probabilistic representation of the uncertainty in sensing and actuation, are used to construct a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). The policy obtained by solving the POMDP is invoked repeatedly to implement the abstract action as a sequence of concrete actions. The fine-resolution outcomes of executing these concrete actions are used to infer coarse-resolution outcomes that are added to the coarse-resolution history and used for subsequent coarse-resolution reasoning. The architecture thus combines the complementary strengths of declarative programming and probabilistic graphical models to represent and reason with non-monotonic logic-based and probabilistic descriptions of uncertainty and incomplete domain knowledge. In addition, we describe a general methodology for the design of software components of a robot based on these knowledge representation and reasoning tools, and provide a path for proving the correctness of these components. The architecture is evaluated in simulation and on a mobile robot finding and moving target objects to desired locations in indoor domains, to show that the architecture supports reliable and efficient reasoning with violation of defaults, noisy observations and unreliable actions, in complex domains.\n",
      "In multi-agent path finding, it is usually assumed that planning is performed centrally and that the destinations of the agents are common knowledge. We will drop both assumptions and analyze under which conditions it can be guaranteed that the agents reach their respective destinations using implicitly coordinated plans without communication.\n",

      "This paper presents a new insight into improving the performance of Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) by using Isolation kernel instead of Gaussian kernel. Isolation kernel outperforms Gaussian kernel in two aspects. First, the use of Isolation kernel in t-SNE overcomes the drawback of misrepresenting some structures in the data, which often occurs when Gaussian kernel is applied in t-SNE. This is because Gaussian kernel determines each local bandwidth based on one local point only, while Isolation kernel is derived directly from the data based on space partitioning. Second, the use of Isolation kernel yields a more efficient similarity computation because data-dependent Isolation kernel has only one parameter that needs to be tuned. In contrast, the use of data-independent Gaussian kernel increases the computational cost by determining n bandwidths for a dataset of n points. As the root cause of these deficiencies in t-SNE is Gaussian kernel, we show that simply replacing Gaussian kernel with Isolation kernel in t-SNE significantly improves the quality of the final visualisation output (without creating misrepresented structures) and removes one key obstacle that prevents t-SNE from processing large datasets. Moreover, Isolation kernel enables t-SNE to deal with large-scale datasets in less runtime without trading off accuracy, unlike existing methods in speeding up t-SNE.\n",
      "In fair division of indivisible goods, ℓ-out-of-d maximin share (MMS) is the value that an agent can guarantee by partitioning the goods into d bundles and choosing the ℓ least preferred bundles. Most existing works aim to guarantee to all agents a constant fraction of their 1-out-of-n MMS. But this guarantee is sensitive to small perturbation in agents' cardinal valuations. We consider a more robust approximation notion, which depends only on the agents' ordinal rankings of bundles. We prove the existence of ℓ-out-of-⌊(ℓ + 1/2)n⌋ MMS allocations of goods for any integer ℓ ≥ 1, and present a polynomial-time algorithm that finds a 1-out-of-⌈3n/2⌉ MMS allocation when ℓ=1. We further develop an algorithm that provides a weaker ordinal approximation to MMS for any ℓ > 1.\n",
      "Robin Hirsch posed in 1996 the Really Big Complexity Problem: classify the computational complexity of the network satisfaction problem for all finite relation algebras A. We provide a complete classification for the case that A is symmetric and has a fexible atom; in this case, the problem is NP-complete or in P. The classification task can be reduced to the case where A is integral. If a finite integral relation algebra has a flexible atom, then it has a normal representation B. We can then study the computational complexity of the network satisfaction problem of A using the universal-algebraic approach, via an analysis of the polymorphisms of B. We also use a Ramsey-type result of Nešetřil and Rödl and a complexity dichotomy result of Bulatov for conservative finite-domain constraint satisfaction problems.\n",
      "We prove risk bounds for halfspace learning when the data dimensionality is allowed to be larger than the sample size, using a notion of compressibility by random projection. In particular, we give upper bounds for the empirical risk minimizer learned efficiently from randomly projected data, as well as uniform upper bounds in the full high-dimensional space. Our main findings are the following: i) In both settings, the obtained bounds are able to discover and take advantage of benign geometric structure, which turns out to depend on the cosine similarities between the classifier and points of the input space, and provide a new interpretation of margin distribution type arguments. ii) Furthermore our bounds allow us to draw new connections between several existing successful classification algorithms, and we also demonstrate that our theory is predictive of empirically observed performance in numerical simulations and experiments. iii) Taken together, these results suggest that the study of compressive learning can improve our understanding of which benign structural traits – if they are possessed by the data generator – make it easier to learn an effective classifier from a sample.\n",
      "Time-series data arises in many real-world applications (e.g., mobile health) and deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown great success in solving them. Despite their success, little is known about their robustness to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial framework referred to as Time-Series Attacks via STATistical Features (TSA-STAT). To address the unique challenges of time-series domain, TSA-STAT employs constraints on statistical features of the time-series data to construct adversarial examples. Optimized polynomial transformations are used to create attacks that are more effective (in terms of successfully fooling DNNs) than those based on additive perturbations. We also provide certified bounds on the norm of the statistical features for constructing adversarial examples. Our experiments on diverse real-world benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of TSA-STAT in fooling DNNs for time-series domain and in improving their robustness.\n",

As ILP turns 30, we provide a new introduction to the field. We introduce the necessary logical notation and the main learning settings; describe the building blocks of an ILP system; compare several systems on several dimensions; describe four systems (Aleph, TILDE, ASPAL, and Metagol); highlight key application areas; and, finally, summarise current limitations and directions for future research.\n",

      "Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the most exciting developments in Computer Science of the last decade. At the same time, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a very successful paradigm for a variety of machine learning tasks. In this survey, we discuss the state of the art, opportunities and open research questions in applying RL to generative AI. In particular, we will discuss three types of applications, namely, RL as an alternative way for generation without specified objectives; as a way for generating outputs while concurrently maximizing an objective function; and, finally, as a way of embedding desired characteristics, which cannot be easily captured by means of an objective function, into the generative process. We conclude the survey with an in-depth discussion of the opportunities and challenges in this fascinating emerging area.\n",
      "Artificial intelligence (AI) and especially reinforcement learning (RL) have the potential to enable agents to learn and perform tasks autonomously with superhuman performance. However, we consider RL as fundamentally a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) paradigm, even when an agent eventually performs its task autonomously. In cases where the reward function is challenging or impossible to define, HITL approaches are considered particularly advantageous. The application of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in systems such as ChatGPT demonstrates the effectiveness of optimizing for user experience and integrating their feedback into the training loop. In HITL RL, human input is integrated during the agent’s learning process, allowing iterative updates and fine-tuning based on human feedback, thus enhancing the agent’s performance. Since the human is an essential part of this process, we argue that human-centric approaches are the key to successful RL, a fact that has not been adequately considered in the existing literature. This paper aims to inform readers about current explainability methods in HITL RL. It also shows how the application of explainable AI (xAI) and specific improvements to existing explainability approaches can enable a better human-agent interaction in HITL RL for all types of users, whether for lay people, domain experts, or machine learning specialists. Accounting for the workflow in HITL RL and based on software and machine learning methodologies, this article identifies four phases for human involvement for creating HITL RL systems: (1) Agent Development, (2) Agent Learning, (3) Agent Evaluation, and (4) Agent Deployment. We highlight human involvement, explanation requirements, new challenges, and goals for each phase. We furthermore identify low-risk, high-return opportunities for explainability research in HITL RL and present long-term research goals to advance the field. Finally, we propose a vision of human-robot collaboration that allows both parties to reach their full potential and cooperate effectively.\n",

      "Weighted voting games are applicable to a wide variety of multi-agent settings. They enable the formalization of power indices which quantify the coalitional power of players. We take a novel approach to the study of the power of big vs.~small players in these games. We model small (big) players as having single (multiple) votes. The aggregate relative power of big players is measured w.r.t.~their votes proportion. For this ratio, we show small constant worst-case bounds for the Shapley-Shubik and the Deegan-Packel indices. In sharp contrast, this ratio is unbounded for the Banzhaf index. As an application, we define a false-name strategic normal form game where each big player may split its votes between false identities, and study its various properties. Together our results provide foundations for the implications of players' size, modeled as their ability to split, on their relative power.\n",
      "Despite achieving accuracies higher than 90% on recognizing upper-limb movements through sEMG (surface Electromyography) signal with the state of art classifiers in the laboratory environment, there are still issues to be addressed for a myo-controlled prosthesis achieve similar performance in real environment conditions. Thereby, the main goal of this review is to expose the latest researches in terms of strategies in each block of the system, giving a global view of the current state of academic research. A systematic review was conducted, and the retrieved papers were organized according to the system step related to the proposed method. Then, for each stage of the upper limb motion recognition system, the works were described and compared in terms of strategy, methodology and issue addressed. An additional section was destined for the description of works related to signal contamination that is often neglected in reviews focused on sEMG based motion classifiers. Therefore, this section is the main contribution of this paper. Deep learning methods are a current trend for classification stage, providing strategies based on time-series and transfer learning to address the issues related to limb position, temporal/inter-subject variation, and electrode displacement. Despite the promising strategies presented for contaminant detection, identification, and removal, there are still some factors to be considered, such as the occurrence of simultaneous contaminants. This review exposes the current scenario of the movement classification system, providing valuable information for new researchers and guiding future works towards myo-controlled devices.\n",
      "We investigate the problem of computing the number of linear extensions of a given partial order on n elements. The problem has applications in numerous areas, such as sorting, planning, and learning graphical models. The problem is #P-hard but admits fully polynomial-time approximation schemes. However, the polynomial complexity bounds of the known schemes involve high degrees and large constant factors, rendering the schemes only feasible when n is some dozens. We present novel schemes, which stem from the idea of not requiring provable polynomial worst-case running time bounds. Using various new algorithmic techniques and implementation optimizations, we discover schemes that yield speedups by several orders of magnitude, enabling accurate approximations even when n is in several hundreds.\n",
      "The minimum connected dominating set (MCDS) problem is an important extension of the minimum dominating set problem, with wide applications, especially in wireless networks. Most previous works focused on solving MCDS problem in graphs with relatively small size, mainly due to the complexity of maintaining connectivity. This paper explores techniques for solving MCDS problem in massive real-world graphs with wide practical importance. Firstly, we propose a local greedy construction method with reasoning rule called 1hopReason. Secondly and most importantly, a hybrid dynamic connectivity maintenance method (HDC+) is designed to switch alternately between a novel fast connectivity maintenance method based on spanning tree and its previous counterpart. Thirdly, we adopt a two-level vertex selection heuristic with a newly proposed scoring function called chronosafety to make the algorithm more considerate when selecting vertices. We design a new local search algorithm called FastCDS based on the three ideas. Experiments show that FastCDS significantly outperforms five state-of-the-art MCDS algorithms on both massive graphs and classic benchmarks.\n",

      "We investigate a formalism for the conditions of a successful explanation of AI. We consider “success” to depend not only on what information the explanation contains, but also on what information the human explainee understands from it. Theory of mind literature discusses the folk concepts that humans use to understand and generalize behavior. We posit that folk concepts of behavior provide us with a “language” that humans understand behavior with. We use these folk concepts as a framework of social attribution by the human explainee—the information constructs that humans are likely to comprehend from explanations—by introducing a blueprint for an explanatory narrative that explains AI behavior with these constructs. We then demonstrate that many XAI methods today can be mapped to folk concepts of behavior in a qualitative evaluation. This allows us to uncover their failure modes that prevent current methods from explaining successfully—i.e., the information constructs that are missing for any given XAI method, and whose inclusion can decrease the likelihood of misunderstanding AI behavior.\n",
      "Recent advances in the areas of multimodal machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) have led to the development of challenging tasks at the intersection of Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Embodied AI. Whereas many approaches and previous survey pursuits have characterised one or two of these dimensions, there has not been a holistic analysis at the center of all three. Moreover, even when combinations of these topics are considered, more focus is placed on describing, e.g., current architectural methods, as opposed to also illustrating high-level challenges and opportunities for the field. In this survey paper, we discuss Embodied Vision-Language Planning (EVLP) tasks, a family of prominent embodied navigation and manipulation problems that jointly use computer vision and natural language. We propose a taxonomy to unify these tasks and provide an in-depth analysis and comparison of the new and current algorithmic approaches, metrics, simulated environments, as well as the datasets used for EVLP tasks. Finally, we present the core challenges that we believe new EVLP works should seek to address, and we advocate for task construction that enables model generalizability and furthers real-world deployment.\n",

      "Graph coloring is an important problem in combinatorial optimization and a major component of numerous allocation and scheduling problems. In this paper we introduce a hybrid CP/SAT approach to graph coloring based on the addition-contraction recurrence of Zykov. Decisions correspond to either adding an edge between two non-adjacent vertices or contracting these two vertices, hence enforcing inequality or equality, respectively. This scheme yields a symmetry-free tree and makes learnt clauses stronger by not committing to a particular color. We introduce a new lower bound for this problem based on Mycielskian graphs; a method to produce a clausal explanation of this bound for use in a CDCL algorithm; a branching heuristic emulating Br´elaz’ heuristic on the Zykov tree; and dedicated pruning techniques relying on marginal costs with respect to the bound and on reasoning about transitivity when unit propagating learnt clauses. The combination of these techniques in both a branch-and-bound and in a bottom-up search outperforms other SAT-based approaches and Dsatur on standard benchmarks both for finding upper bounds and for proving lower bounds.\n",

As the root cause of these deficiencies in t-SNE is Gaussian kernel, we show that simply replacing Gaussian kernel with Isolation kernel in t-SNE significantly improves the quality of the final visualisation output (without creating misrepresented structures) and removes one key obstacle that prevents t-SNE from processing large datasets. Moreover, Isolation kernel enables t-SNE to deal with large-scale datasets in less runtime without trading off accuracy, unlike existing methods in speeding up t-SNE.\n",
      "From the perspective of a dialog system, it is important to identify the intention behind the segments in a dialog, since it provides an important cue regarding the information that is present in the segments and how they should be interpreted. ISO 24617-2, the standard for dialog act annotation, defines a hierarchically organized set of general-purpose communicative functions which correspond to different intentions that are relevant in the context of a dialog. We explore the automatic recognition of these communicative functions in the DialogBank, which is a reference set of dialogs annotated according to this standard. To do so, we propose adaptations of existing approaches to flat dialog act recognition that allow them to deal with the hierarchical classification problem. More specifically, we propose the use of an end-to-end hierarchical network with cascading outputs and maximum a posteriori path estimation to predict the communicative function at each level of the hierarchy, preserve the dependencies between the functions in the path, and decide at which level to stop. Furthermore, since the amount of dialogs in the DialogBank is small, we rely on transfer learning processes to reduce overfitting and improve performance. The results of our experiments show that our approach outperforms both a flat one and hierarchical approaches based on multiple classifiers and that each of its components plays an important role towards the recognition of general-purpose communicative functions.\n",
      "We prove risk bounds for halfspace learning when the data dimensionality is allowed to be larger than the sample size, using a notion of compressibility by random projection. In particular, we give upper bounds for the empirical risk minimizer learned efficiently from randomly projected data, as well as uniform upper bounds in the full high-dimensional space. Our main findings are the following: i) In both settings, the obtained bounds are able to discover and take advantage of benign geometric structure, which turns out to depend on the cosine similarities between the classifier and points of the input space, and provide a new interpretation of margin distribution type arguments. ii) Furthermore our bounds allow us to draw new connections between several existing successful classification algorithms, and we also demonstrate that our theory is predictive of empirically observed performance in numerical simulations and experiments. iii) Taken together, these results suggest that the study of compressive learning can improve our understanding of which benign structural traits – if they are possessed by the data generator – make it easier to learn an effective classifier from a sample.\n",
      "The core principle of Variational Inference (VI) is to convert the statistical inference problem of computing complex posterior probability densities into a tractable optimization problem. This property enables VI to be faster than several sampling-based techniques. However, the traditional VI algorithm is not scalable to large data sets and is unable to readily infer out-of-bounds data points without re-running the optimization process. Recent developments in the field, like stochastic-, black box-, and amortized-VI, have helped address these issues. Generative modeling tasks nowadays widely make use of amortized VI for its efficiency and scalability, as it utilizes a parameterized function to learn the approximate posterior density parameters. In this paper, we review the mathematical foundations of various VI techniques to form the basis for understanding amortized VI. Additionally, we provide an overview of the recent trends that address several issues of amortized VI, such as the amortization gap, generalization issues, inconsistent representation learning, and posterior collapse. Finally, we analyze alternate divergence measures that improve VI optimization.\n",
