This scheme yields a symmetry-free tree and makes learnt clauses stronger by not committing to a particular color. We introduce a new lower bound for this problem based on Mycielskian graphs; a method to produce a clausal explanation of this bound for use in a CDCL algorithm; a branching heuristic emulating Br´elaz’ heuristic on the Zykov tree; and dedicated pruning techniques relying on marginal costs with respect to the bound and on reasoning about transitivity when unit propagating learnt clauses.

Previous works have made substantial advancements in designing various online selection solutions for MAB, however, when incorporating such fairness constraints, they fail to achieve a sublinear regret bound.

In particular, we design a new selection algorithm that solves MAB problems from an online convex optimization perspective. Our algorithm is computationally efficient, and more importantly, manages to achieve a sublinear regret bound of O( √ T ln T) with high probability guarantees in T selection rounds.

Situations involving multiple decision makers are particularly complex, leading to computational intractability of principled solution methods. A body of work in AI has tried to mitigate this problem by trying to distill interaction to its essence: how does the policy of one agent influence another agent? If we can find more compact representations of such influence, this can help us deal with the complexity, for instance by searching the space of influences rather than the space of policies. However, so far these notions of influence have been restricted in their applicability to special cases of interaction. In this paper we formalize influence-based abstraction (IBA), which facilitates the elimination of latent state factors without any loss in value, for a very general class of problems described as factored partially observable stochastic games (fPOSGs). On the one hand, this generalizes existing descriptions of influence, and thus can serve as the foundation for improvements in scalability and other insights in decision making in complex multiagent settings. On the other hand, since the presence of other agents can be seen as a generalization of single agent settings, our formulation of IBA also provides a sufficient statistic for decision making under abstraction for a single agent. We also give a detailed discussion of the relations to such previous works, identifying new insights and interpretations of these approaches. In these ways, this paper deepens our understanding of abstraction in a wide range of sequential decision making settings, providing the basis for new approaches and algorithms for a large class of problems.", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9946aa012425820b6c6f14ad9158148f41bdb695"}

At the same time, the review of each paper is a laborious process that must be carried out by subject matter experts. Thus, providing high-quality reviews of this growing number of papers is a significant challenge. In this work, we ask the question “can we automate scientific reviewing? ”, discussing the possibility of using natural language processing (NLP) models to generate peer reviews for scientific papers. Because it is non-trivial to define what a “good” review is in the first place, we first discuss possible evaluation metrics that could be used to judge success in this task. We then focus on the machine learning domain and collect a dataset of papers in the domain, annotate them with different aspects of content covered in each review, and train targeted summarization models that take in papers as input and generate reviews as output. Comprehensive experimental results on the test set show that while system-generated reviews are comprehensive, touching upon more aspects of the paper than human-written reviews, the generated texts are less constructive and less factual than human-written reviews for all aspects except the explanation of the core ideas of the papers, which are largely factually correct. Given these results, we pose eight challenges in the pursuit of a good review generation system together with potential solutions, which, hopefully, will inspire more future research in this direction.\nWe make relevant resource publicly available for use by future research: https://github. com/neulab/ReviewAdvisor.

One measure of the parallelizability of a submodular maximization algorithm is its adaptive complexity, which indicates the number of sequential rounds where a polynomial number of queries to the objective function can be executed in parallel. In this paper, we study the problem of non-monotone submodular maximization subject to a knapsack constraint, and propose a low-adaptivity algorithm achieving an (1/8 − ϵ)- approximation with practical Õ(n) query complexity. Moreover, we also propose the first algorithm with both provable approximation ratio and sublinear adaptive complexity for the problem of non-monotone submodular maximization subject to a k-system constraint.

Alternatively, specific parametric nonlinear functions can be used, but the specification of such functions is in general complicated. In this paper, we introduce a  flexible approach for the construction and selection of highly  flexible nonlinear parametric regression models.

However, POMDPs are notoriously difficult to solve, especially when the state and observation spaces are continuous or hybrid, which is often the case for physical systems. While recent online sampling-based POMDP algorithms that plan with observation likelihood weighting have shown practical effectiveness, a general theory characterizing the approximation error of the particle filtering techniques that these algorithms use has not previously been proposed. Our main contribution is bounding the error between any POMDP and its corresponding finite sample particle belief MDP (PB-MDP) approximation. This fundamental bridge between PB-MDPs and POMDPs allows us to adapt any sampling-based MDP algorithm to a POMDP by solving the corresponding particle belief MDP, thereby extending the convergence guarantees of the MDP algorithm to the POMDP. Practically, this is implemented by using the particle filter belief transition model as the generative model for the MDP solver. While this requires access to the observation density model from the POMDP, it only increases the transition sampling complexity of the MDP solver by a factor of O(C), where C is the number of particles. Thus, when combined with sparse sampling MDP algorithms, this approach can yield algorithms for POMDPs that have no direct theoretical dependence on the size of the state and observation spaces. In addition to our theoretical contribution, we perform five numerical experiments on benchmark POMDPs to demonstrate that a simple MDP algorithm adapted using PB-MDP approximation, Sparse-PFT, achieves performance competitive with other leading continuous observation POMDP solvers.", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7e7a24d551fade59e5a1cd40c5135be18cf81527"}

An action language is extended to support non-boolean fluents and non-deterministic causal laws, and used to describe the domain's transition diagrams, with the fine-resolution transition diagram being defined as a refinement of the coarse-resolution transition diagram. The coarse-resolution system description, and a history that includes prioritized defaults, are translated into an Answer Set Prolog (ASP) program. For any given goal, inference in the ASP program provides a plan of abstract actions. To implement each such abstract action, the robot automatically zooms to the part of the fine-resolution transition diagram relevant to this action. The zoomed fine-resolution system description, and a probabilistic representation of the uncertainty in sensing and actuation, are used to construct a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). The policy obtained by solving the POMDP is invoked repeatedly to implement the abstract action as a sequence of concrete actions. The fine-resolution outcomes of executing these concrete actions are used to infer coarse-resolution outcomes that are added to the coarse-resolution history and used for subsequent coarse-resolution reasoning. The architecture thus combines the complementary strengths of declarative programming and probabilistic graphical models to represent and reason with non-monotonic logic-based and probabilistic descriptions of uncertainty and incomplete domain knowledge. In addition, we describe a general methodology for the design of software components of a robot based on these knowledge representation and reasoning tools, and provide a path for proving the correctness of these components.

Machine learning techniques, especially Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have shown promise in parametrizing and automating this laborious design process. The inductive bias of GNNs allows for learning solutions to mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulations of constrained CO problems with a relational representation of decision variables and constraints. The trained GNNs can be leveraged with primal heuristics to construct high-quality feasible solutions to CO problems quickly. However, current GNN-based end-to-end learning approaches have limitations for scalable training and generalization on larger-scale instances; therefore, they have been mostly evaluated over small-scale instances. Addressing this issue, our study builds on supervised learning of optimal solutions to the downscaled instances of given large-scale CO problems. We introduce several improvements on a recent GNN model for CO to generalize on instances of a larger scale than those used in training. We also propose a two-stage primal heuristic strategy based on uncertainty-quantification to automatically configure how solution search relies on the predicted decision values. Our models can generalize on 16x upscaled instances of commonly benchmarked five CO problems. Unlike the regressive performance of existing GNN-based CO approaches as the scale of problems increases, the CO pipelines using our models offer an incremental performance improvement relative to CPLEX. The proposed uncertainty-based primal heuristics provide 6-75% better optimality gap values and 45-99% better primal gap values for the 16x upscaled instances and brings immense speedup to obtain high-quality solutions.

To date, many aggregation models have been proposed for simple categorical or numerical annotation tasks, but far less work has considered more complex annotation tasks, such as those involving open-ended, multivariate, or structured responses. Similarly, while a variety of bespoke models have been proposed for specific tasks, our work is the first we are aware of to introduce aggregation methods that generalize across many, diverse complex tasks, including sequence labeling, translation, syntactic parsing, ranking, bounding boxes, and keypoints. This generality is achieved by applying readily available task-specific distance functions, then devising a task-agnostic method to model these distances between labels, rather than the labels themselves.\nThis article presents a unified treatment of our prior work on complex annotation modeling and extends that work with investigation of three new research questions. First, how do complex annotation task and dataset properties impact aggregation accuracy? Second, how should a task owner navigate the many modeling choices in order to maximize aggregation accuracy? Finally, what tests and diagnoses can verify that aggregation models are specified correctly for the given data? To understand how various factors impact accuracy and to inform model selection, we conduct large-scale simulation studies and broad experiments on real, complex datasets. Regarding testing, we introduce the concept of unit tests for aggregation models and present a suite of such tests to ensure that a given model is not mis-specified and exhibits expected behavior.\nBeyond investigating these research questions above, we discuss the foundational concept and nature of annotation complexity, present a new aggregation model as a conceptual bridge between traditional models and our own, and contribute a new general semisupervised learning method for complex label aggregation that outperforms prior work.", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2a3b45215d0cd71c8f57c8525b63cf8425409b89"}

However, no unifying formalism for applying logic operators to tasks and generalising combinatorially over them has yet been developed. We address the problem by formally defining logical composition as operators acting on a set of tasks in a lattice structure—the algebraic structure that generalises the study of Boolean logic.

Isolation kernel outperforms Gaussian kernel in two aspects. First, the use of Isolation kernel in t-SNE overcomes the drawback of misrepresenting some structures in the data, which often occurs when Gaussian kernel is applied in t-SNE. This is because Gaussian kernel determines each local bandwidth based on one local point only, while Isolation kernel is derived directly from the data based on space partitioning. Second, the use of Isolation kernel yields a more efficient similarity computation because data-dependent Isolation kernel has only one parameter that needs to be tuned. In contrast, the use of data-independent Gaussian kernel increases the computational cost by determining n bandwidths for a dataset of n points. As the root cause of these deficiencies in t-SNE is Gaussian kernel, we show that simply replacing Gaussian kernel with Isolation kernel in t-SNE significantly improves the quality of the final visualisation output (without creating misrepresented structures) and removes one key obstacle that prevents t-SNE from processing large datasets. Moreover, Isolation kernel enables t-SNE to deal with large-scale datasets in less runtime without trading off accuracy, unlike existing methods in speeding up t-SNE.", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/094cb2b6424d40a9855b6f0361fa4e7740a171c0"}

When the input grid is static further speedups can be obtained by combining JPS with goal bounding techniques such as Geometric Containers (instantiated as Bounding Boxes) and Compressed Path Databases. Two such methods, JPS+BB and Two-Oracle Path PlannING (Topping), are currently among the fastest known approaches for computing shortest paths on grids. The principal drawback for these algorithms is the overhead costs: each one requires an all-pairs precomputation step, the running time and subsequent storage costs of which can be prohibitive. In this work we consider an alternative approach where we precompute and store goal bounding data only for grid cells which are also jump points. Since the number of jump points is usually much smaller than the total number of grid cells, we can save up to orders of magnitude in preprocessing time and space. \nConsiderable precomputation savings do not necessarily mean performance degradation. For a second contribution we show how canonical orderings, partial expansion strategies and enhanced intermediate pruning can be leveraged to improve online query performance despite a reduction in preprocessed data. The combination of faster preprocessing and stronger online reasoning leads to three new and highly performant algorithms: JPS+BB+ and Two-Oracle Pathfinding Search (TOPS) based on search, and Topping+ based on path extraction. We give a theoretical analysis showing that each method is complete and optimal.

Tackling this arduous challenge first necessitates defining what it means for an ML model to be fair. This has been addressed by the ML community with various measures of fairness that depend on the prediction outcomes of the ML models, either at the group-level or the individual-level. These fairness measures are limited in that they utilize point predictions, neglecting their variances, or uncertainties, making them susceptible to noise, missingness and shifts in data. In this paper, we first show that a ML model may appear to be fair with existing point-based fairness measures but biased against a demographic group in terms of prediction uncertainties. Then, we introduce new fairness measures based on different types of uncertainties, namely, aleatoric uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty. We demonstrate on many datasets that (i) our uncertaintybased measures are complementary to existing measures of fairness, and (ii) they provide more insights about the underlying issues leading to bias.", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8302a913a12121826d8e08c2c48d9da04d4d6449"}

With the vast knowledge bases and advanced reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), these models are particularly well-suited to supplement auxiliary information and capture implicit user intent. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, ER2ALM, which leverages the capabilities of LLMs enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve recommendation outcomes. Our framework specifically addresses the challenges by flexibly and accurately augmenting auxiliary information and capturing users’ implicit preferences and interests. Additionally, to mitigate the risk of introducing noise, we incorporate a noise reduction strategy to ensure the reliability of the augmented information. Experimental validation on two real-world datasets demonstrates the efficacy of our approach, significantly enhancing both the accuracy and robustness of recommendations compared to state-of-the-art methods.

While previously the attention was mostly on efficiency, more recently fairness issues have been taken into account in this scope. In the present paper, we propose to use randomization as a mean for achieving fairness. While this general idea is not new, it has not been applied in this area. \nSimilar to previous works like Fish et al. (WWW ’19) and Tsang et al. (IJCAI ’19), we study the maximin criterion for (group) fairness. In contrast to their work however, we model the problem in such a way that, when choosing the seed sets, probabilistic strategies are possible rather than only deterministic ones. We introduce two different variants of this probabilistic problem, one that entails probabilistic strategies over nodes (node-based problem) and a second one that entails probabilistic strategies over sets of nodes (set-based problem). After analyzing the relation between the two probabilistic problems, we show that, while the original deterministic maximin problem was inapproximable, both probabilistic variants permit approximation algorithms that achieve a constant multiplicative factor of 1 − 1/e minus an additive arbitrarily small error that is due to the simulation of the information spread. For the node-based problem, the approximation is achieved by observing that a polynomial-sized linear program approximates the problem well. For the set-based problem, we show that a multiplicative-weight routine can yield the approximation result. \nFor an experimental study, we provide implementations of multiplicative-weight routines for both the set-based and the node-based problems and compare the achieved fairness values to existing methods. Maybe non-surprisingly, we show that the ex-ante values, i.e., minimum expected value of an individual (or group) to obtain the information, of the computed probabilistic strategies are significantly larger than the (ex-post) fairness values of previous methods. This indicates that studying fairness via randomization is a worthwhile path to follow. Interestingly and maybe more surprisingly, we observe that even the ex-post fairness values, i.e., fairness values of sets sampled according to the probabilistic strategies computed by our routines, dominate over the fairness achieved by previous methods on many of the instances tested.", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2e5a68733134ad1bcb9f64e3cb96a3feed7af300"}

Therefore, we present novel syntax and semantics for declarative specifications of domain-specific heuristics in ASP. Our approach supports heuristic statements that depend on the partial assignment maintained during solving, which has not been possible before. We provide an implementation in Alpha that makes Alpha the first lazy-grounding ASP system to support declaratively specified domain-specific heuristics.

Regret quantifies the difference between a learner’s performance against a baseline in hindsight. It is well known that regret-minimizing algorithms converge to certain classes of equilibria in games; however, traditional forms of regret used in game theory predominantly consider baselines that permit deviations to deterministic actions or strategies. In this paper, we revisit our understanding of regret from the perspective of deviations over partitions of the full mixed strategy space (i.e., probability distributions over pure strategies), under the lens of the previously-established Φ-regret framework, which provides a continuum of stronger regret measures. Importantly, Φ-regret enables learning agents to consider deviations from and to mixed strategies, generalizing several existing notions of regret such as external, internal, and swap regret, and thus broadening the insights gained from regret-based analysis of learning algorithms. We prove here that the well-studied evolutionary learning algorithm of replicator dynamics (RD) seamlessly minimizes the strongest possible form of Φ-regret in generic 2 × 2 games, without any modification of the underlying algorithm itself. We subsequently conduct experiments validating our theoretical results in a suite of 144 2 × 2 games wherein RD exhibits a diverse set of behaviors.

Existing works that study shared resources assume that the resource allocated to a node can be shared or duplicated between neighboring nodes. However, in the real world, sharing resource naturally leads to a decrease in defending power of the source node, especially when defending against contagious attacks. Therefore, we study the model in which resources allocated to a node can only be transferred to its neighboring nodes, which we refer to as a reallocation process.

In recent years, significant progress has been made with transformer-based models that leverage deep learning in combination with large amounts of text data. However, a significant challenge with QA systems lies in their complexity rooted in the ambiguity and flexibility of a natural language. This makes even their evaluation a formidable task. For this reason, in this study, we focus on the evaluation of extractive question-answering (EQA) systems by conducting a large-scale analysis of distilBERT using benchmark data provided by the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD). Specifically, the main objectives of this paper are fourfold. First, we study the influence of the answer length on the performance and we demonstrate that there is an inverse correlation between both. Second, we study differences in exact match (EM) measures because there are different definitions commonly used in the literature. As a result, we find that despite the fact that all of those measures are named ”exact match” these measures are actually different from each other. Third, we study the practical relevance of these different definitions because due to the ambivalent meaning of ”exact match” in the literature, it is often unclear if reported improvements are genuine or only due to a change in the exact match measure. Importantly, our results show that differences between differently defined EM measures are in the same order of magnitude as reported differences found in the literature. This raises concerns about the robustness of reported results. Fourth, we provide guidelines to improve the experimental design of general EQA studies, aiming to enhance performance evaluation and minimize the potential for spurious results.", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8fadd7998d04ccd75726b1d3b071afd7fb0b0f2a"}

However, existing methods have difficulty scaling to systems with more than a handful of components. Discrete, consistency based state estimation capabilities can scale to this level by combining best-first enumeration and conflict-directed search.

These approaches are not applicable in over-constrained controllability problems, when it is certain that all constraints can’t be satisfied. We introduce the Weighted Probabilistic Simple Temporal Network with Uncertainty (WPSTNU), which extends the PSTNU by attaching a fixed value to the satisfaction of temporal constraints, and allows the schedule to violate some constraints in order to maximize the expected value of satisfying others. We study the problem of Expected Value Strong Controllability (EvSC) of WPSTNUs, which seeks a fixed-time schedule maximizing the expected value of satisfied constraints. We solve the EvSC problem using a mixed integer linear program (MILP) that bounds below the probability of satisfying constraints involving uncontrollable timepoints. While solving MILPs generally takes exponential time, we demonstrate our formulation’s effective performance using scheduling problems derived from the HEATlab and MIT ROVERS data sets. We then show how to use this MILP to reschedule during execution, after time has passed and uncertainty is reduced. We describe different fixed-period rescheduling approaches, including time-based and event-based, and report on the most successful strategies compared to the expected value of the fixed schedule produced by the MILP. All of our methods are evaluated on problems with both symmetric and asymmetric (skewed) probability distributions.

A general purpose strategy for state construction is to learn the state update using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), which updates the internal state using the current internal state and the most recent observation. This internal state provides a summary of the observed sequence, to facilitate accurate predictions and decision-making. At the same time, specifying and training RNNs is notoriously tricky, particularly as the common strategy to approximate gradients back in time, called truncated Back-prop Through Time (BPTT), can be sensitive to the truncation window. Further, domain-expertise—which can usually help constrain the function class and so improve trainability—can be difficult to incorporate into complex recurrent units used within RNNs. In this work, we explore how to use multi-step predictions to constrain the RNN and incorporate prior knowledge. In particular, we revisit the idea of using predictions to construct state and ask: does constraining (parts of) the state to consist of predictions about the future improve RNN trainability? We formulate a novel RNN architecture, called a General Value Function Network (GVFN), where each internal state component corresponds to a prediction about the future represented as a value function.

They have the ability to flexibly and accurately model treatment response at the individual level, potentially allowing us to better match available resources to individuals. In addition, they have the ability to reason simultaneously about the effects of matching sets of scarce resources to populations of individuals. In this work, we leverage these abilities to study algorithmic allocation of scarce societal resources in the context of homelessness. In communities throughout the United States, there is constant demand for an array of homeless services intended to address different levels of need. Allocations of housing services must match households to appropriate services that continuously fluctuate in availability, while inefficiencies in allocation could “waste” scarce resources as households will remain in-need and re-enter the homeless system, increasing the overall demand for homeless services. This complex allocation problem introduces novel technical and ethical challenges. Using administrative data from a regional homeless system, we formulate the problem of “optimal” allocation of resources given data on households with need for homeless services. The optimization problem aims to allocate available resources such that predicted probabilities of household re-entry are minimized. The key element of this work is its use of a counterfactual prediction approach that predicts household probabilities of re-entry into homeless services if assigned to each service. Through these counterfactual predictions, we find that this approach has the potential to improve the efficiency of the homeless system by reducing re-entry, and, therefore, system-wide demand. However, efficiency comes with trade-offs - a significant fraction of households are assigned to services that increase probability of re-entry. To address this issue as well as the inherent fairness considerations present in any context where there are insufficient resources to meet demand, we discuss the efficiency, equity, and fairness issues that arise in our work and consider potential implications for homeless policies.", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/408b14bd1a973c65baab85ea1f97f0730a043cd4"}

This raises a natural question: How optimal can polynomial-time algorithms reach? Whereas algorithms for computing constant-factor optimal solutions have been developed, the constant factor is generally very large, limiting their application potential. In this work, among other breakthroughs, we propose the first low-polynomial-time MAPF algorithms delivering 1-1.5 (resp., 1-1.67) asymptotic makespan optimality guarantees for 2D (resp., 3D) grids for random instances at a very high 1/3 agent density, with high probability. Moreover, when regularly distributed obstacles are introduced, our methods experience no performance degradation. These methods generalize to support 100% agent density.\nRegardless of the dimensionality and density, our high-quality methods are enabled by a unique hierarchical integration of two key building blocks. At the higher level, we apply the labeled Grid Rearrangement Algorithm (GRA), capable of performing efficient reconfiguration on grids through row/column shuffles. At the lower level, we devise novel methods that efficiently simulate row/column shuffles returned by GRA. Our implementations of GRA-based algorithms are highly effective in extensive numerical evaluations, demonstrating excellent scalability compared to other SOTA methods. For example, in 3D settings, GRA-based algorithms readily scale to grids with over 370,000 vertices and over 120,000 agents and consistently achieve conservative makespan optimality approaching 1.5, as predicted by our theoretical analysis.", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0ab207038965727a201d1ebf219a4987beed121b"}

Much of this research is focused on studying how individuals faced with a dilemma can learn to cooperate by adapting their behaviours according to their past experience.

It does not control the given, fixed, value of variables. Boolean observation games are a generalization of Boolean games, a well-studied subclass of strategic games but with complete information, and wherein each player controls the value of its variables.\nIn Boolean observation games, player goals describe multi-agent knowledge of variables. As in classical strategic games, players choose their strategies simultaneously and therefore observation games capture aspects of both imperfect and incomplete information. They require reasoning about sets of outcomes given sets of indistinguishable valuations of variables. An outcome relation between such sets determines what the Nash equilibria are. We present various outcome relations, including a qualitative variant of ex-post equilibrium. We identify conditions under which, given an outcome relation, Nash equilibria are guaranteed to exist. We also study the complexity of checking for the existence of Nash equilibria and of verifying if a strategy profile is a Nash equilibrium. We further study the subclass of Boolean observation games with ‘knowing whether’ goal formulas, for which the satisfaction does not depend on the value of variables.

In contrast to plain Datalog, where materialisation (a.k.a. forward chaining) naturally terminates in finitely many steps, reaching a fixpoint in DatalogMTL may require infinitely many rounds of rule applications. As a result, existing reasoning systems resort to other approaches, such as constructing large Büchi automata, whose implementations turn out to be highly inefficient in practice.\nIn this paper, we propose and study finitely materialisable DatalogMTL programs, for which forward chaining reasoning is guaranteed to terminate. We consider a data-dependent notion of finite materialisability of a program, where termination is guaranteed for a given dataset, as well as a data-independent notion, where termination is guaranteed regardless of the dataset. We show that, for bounded programs (a natural DatalogMTL fragment for which reasoning is as hard as in the full language), checking data-dependent finite materialisability is ExpSpace-complete in combined complexity and PSpace-complete in data complexity; furthermore, we propose a practical materialisation-based decision procedure that works in doubly exponential time. We show that checking data-independent finite materialisability for bounded progams is computationally easier, namely ExpTime-complete; moreover, we propose sufficient conditions for data-indenpendent finite materialisability that can be efficiently checked. We provide also the complexity landscape of fact entailment for different classes of finitely materialisable programs; surprisingly, we could identify a large class of finitely materialisable programs, called MTL-acyclic programs, for which fact entailment has exactly the same data and combined complexity as in plain Datalog, which makes this fragment especially well suited for big-scale applications.\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ea1a7edbfbc0c9c6597207702ddf6a23f3145216"}

Each agent can select, as strategy, one of k different colors, and her payoff in a given state (a k-coloring) is given by the number of outgoing neighbors with a color different from her one. Such games model lots of strategic real-world scenarios and are related to several fundamental classes of anti-coordination games. Unfortunately, the problem of understanding whether an instance of the game admits a pure Nash equilibrium (NE), i.e., a state where no agent can improve her payoff by changing strategy, is NP-complete. Thus, in this paper, we focus on algorithms to compute an approximate NE: informally, a coloring is an approximate γ-NE, for some γ ≥ 1, if no agent can improve her payoff, by changing strategy, by a multiplicative factor of γ. \nOur contribution is manifold and of both theoretical and experimental nature. First, we characterize the hardness of finding pure and approximate equilibria in both general and special classes of digraphs. Second, we design and analyze three approximation algorithms with different theoretical guarantees on the approximation ratio, under different conditions; (i) algorithm APPROX-1 which computes, for any k ≥ 3, a Δo-NE for any n vertex graph having a maximum outdegree of Δo, in polynomial time; (ii) algorithm LLL-SPE, a randomized algorithm that, for any constant k ≥ 2, determines a γ-NE for some constant γ but only in digraphs whose minimum outdegree is sufficiently large, in polynomial time in expectation; (iii) algorithm APPROX-3 which, for any ε, computes a (1+ε)-NE by using O(log(n)/ε) colors, for any n-vertex digraph. Note that, the latter shows that a (1+ε)-NE exists and can be computed in polynomial time for k = O(log(n)). \nFinally, to assess how proposed algorithms behave in the typical case, we complete our study with an extensive experimental evaluation showing that, while newly introduced algorithms achieve bounded worst case behavior, they generally perform poorly in practice. Motivated by such unsatisfactory performance, we shift our attention to the best-response paradigm, successfully applied to other classes of games, and design and experimentally evaluate it a heuristic based on such paradigm. Our experiments provide strong evidences of such approach outperforming, in terms of approximation and computational time, all other methods and hence identify it as the most suited candidate for practical usage. More remarkably, it is also able to compute exact, pure NE in the great majority of cases. This suggests that, while these games are known to not always possess a pure NE, such an equilibrium often exists and can be efficiently computed, even by a distributed uncoordinated interaction of the agents.", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bbec44eea0feef1ce6fc607ea9b2c9351ae66de6"}

Upper bounds for query conservative extensions are particularly challenging because characterizations in terms of unbounded homomorphisms between universal models, which are the foundation of the standard approach to establishing decidability, fail in the presence of inverse roles.

Several execution skill estimation methods are presented, each of which utilize different information from the observations and make assumptions about the agent’s decision-making ability. A final novel method forgoes these assumptions about decision-making and instead estimates the execution and decision-making skills simultaneously under a single Bayesian framework. Experimental results in several domains evaluate the estimation accuracy of the estimators, especially focusing on how robust they are as agents and their decision-making methods are varied. These results demonstrate that reasoning about both types of skill together significantly improves the robustness and accuracy of execution skill estimation.

The former analyzes user-generated data to learn user preferences and item characteristics in the form of latent feature vectors, whereas the latter ranks the candidate items based on the learnt vectors and returns the top-k items from the ranked list.

However, in the classic persuasion games setting, the messages sent from the expert to the decision-maker are abstract or well-structured application-specific signals rather than natural (human) language messages, although natural language is a very common communication signal in real-world persuasion setups. This paper addresses the use of natural language in persuasion games, exploring its impact on the decisions made by the players and aiming to construct effective models for the prediction of these decisions. \nFor this purpose, we conduct an online repeated interaction experiment. At each trial of the interaction, an informed expert aims to sell an uninformed decision-maker a vacation in a hotel, by sending her a review that describes the hotel. While the expert is exposed to several scored reviews, the decision-maker observes only the single review sent by the expert, and her payoff in case she chooses to take the hotel is a random draw from the review score distribution available to the expert only. The expert’s payoff, in turn, depends on the number of times the decision-maker chooses the hotel. We also compare the behavioral patterns in this experiment to the equivalent patterns in similar experiments where the communication is based on the numerical values of the reviews rather than the reviews’ text, and observe substantial differences which can be explained through an equilibrium analysis of the game. \nWe consider a number of modeling approaches for our verbal communication setup, differing from each other in the model type (deep neural network (DNN) vs. linear classifier), the type of features used by the model (textual, behavioral or both) and the source of the textual features (DNN-based vs. hand-crafted). Our results demonstrate that given a prefix of the interaction sequence, our models can predict the future decisions of the decision-maker, particularly when a sequential modeling approach and hand-crafted textual features are applied. Further analysis of the hand-crafted textual features allows us to make initial observations about the aspects of text that drive decision making in our setup.", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3c18ccac440a5062c770b31bb6b3b746fe08b432"}

We posit that folk concepts of behavior provide us with a “language” that humans understand behavior with. We use these folk concepts as a framework of social attribution by the human explainee—the information constructs that humans are likely to comprehend from explanations—by introducing a blueprint for an explanatory narrative that explains AI behavior with these constructs. We then demonstrate that many XAI methods today can be mapped to folk concepts of behavior in a qualitative evaluation.

With the recent advances in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), concept-level explanations are receiving an increasing amount of attention from the broad research community. However, laypeople may find such explanations difficult to digest due to the potential knowledge gap and the concomitant cognitive load. Inspired by prior work that has explored analogies and sensemaking, we argue that augmenting concept-level explanations with analogical inference information from commonsense knowledge can be a potential solution to tackle this issue. To investigate the validity of our proposition, we first designed an effective analogy-based explanation generation method and collected 600 analogy-based explanations from 100 crowd workers. Next, we proposed a set of structured dimensions for the qualitative assessment of such explanations, and conducted an empirical evaluation of the generated analogies with experts. Our findings revealed significant positive correlations between the qualitative dimensions of analogies and the perceived helpfulness of analogy-based explanations, suggesting the effectiveness of the dimensions. To understand the practical utility and the effectiveness of analogybased explanations in assisting human decision-making, we conducted a follow-up empirical study (N = 280) on a skin cancer detection task with non-expert humans and an imperfect AI system. Thus, we designed a between-subjects study spanning five different experimental conditions with varying types of explanations. The results of our study confirmed that a knowledge gap can prevent participants from understanding concept-level explanations. Consequently, when only the target domain of our designed analogy-based explanation was provided (in a specific experimental condition), participants demonstrated relatively more appropriate reliance on the AI system. In contrast to our expectations, we found that analogies were not effective in fostering appropriate reliance. We carried out a qualitative analysis of the open-ended responses from participants in the study regarding their perceived usefulness of explanations and analogies. Our findings suggest that human intuition and the perceived plausibility of analogies may have played a role in affecting user reliance on the AI system. We also found that the understanding of commonsense explanations varied with the varying experience of the recipient user, which points out the need for further work on personalization when leveraging commonsense explanations. In summary, although we did not find quantitative support for our hypotheses around the benefits of using analogies, we found considerable qualitative evidence suggesting the potential of high-quality analogies in aiding non-expert users in their decision making with AI-assistance. These insights can inform the design of future methods for the generation and use of effective analogy-based explanations.", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/96e1da7587c4b315ae03e86cf993016ce6ae1fe3"}

Conventional approaches typically rely on labeled training samples for fine-tuning pre-trained language models (PLMs) to enhance classification performance.

In response to this challenge, we present the Multi-modal Attentive Prompt (MAP) learning framework, tailored specifically for few-shot emotion recognition in conversations. The MAP framework consists of four integral modules: multi-modal feature extraction for the sequential embedding of text, visual, and acoustic inputs; a multi-modal prompt generation module that creates six manually-designed multi-modal prompts; an attention mechanism for prompt aggregation; and an emotion inference module for emotion prediction. To evaluate our proposed model’s efficacy, we conducted extensive experiments on two widely recognized benchmark datasets, MELD and IEMOCAP. Our results demonstrate that the MAP framework outperforms state-of-the-art ERC models, yielding notable improvements of 3.5% and 0.4% in micro F1 scores.

By mimicking the actions chosen by a traditional, non-learning planner on a handful of small problems in a domain, ASNets are able to learn a generalised reactive policy that can quickly solve much larger instances from the domain.

However, the ubiquity of modern sensors allows us to collect large quantities of data from each of these complex systems and build accurate, nonlinear deep neural network models of their state transitions. But there remains one major problem for the task of control – how can we plan with deep network learned transition models without resorting to Monte Carlo Tree Search and other black-box transition model techniques that ignore model structure and do not easily extend to continuous domains? In this paper, we introduce two types of planning methods that can leverage deep neural network learned transition models: Hybrid Deep MILP Planner (HD-MILP-Plan) and Tensorflow Planner (TF-Plan). In HD-MILP-Plan, we make the critical observation that the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) transfer function for deep networks not only allows faster convergence of model learning, but also permits a direct compilation of the deep network transition model to a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) encoding. Further, we identify deep network specific optimizations for HD-MILP-Plan that improve performance over a base encoding and show that we can plan optimally with respect to the learned deep networks. In TF-Plan, we take advantage of the efficiency of auto-differentiation tools and GPU-based computation where we encode a subclass of purely continuous planning problems as Recurrent Neural Networks and directly optimize the actions through backpropagation. We compare both planners and show that TF-Plan is able to approximate the optimal plans found by HD-MILP-Plan in less computation time. Hence this article offers two novel planners for continuous state and action domains with learned deep neural net transition models: one optimal method (HD-MILP-Plan) and a scalable alternative for large-scale problems (TF-Plan).", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/45ef947bc9ef6bf82a3d20960ee22f412798d827"}

Five variants of MIRL are considered: uCS-MIRL, advE-MIRL, cooE-MIRL, uCE-MIRL, and uNE-MIRL, each distinguished by its solution concept. Problem uCS-MIRL is a cooperative game in which the agents employ cooperative strategies that aim to maximize the total game value. In problem uCE-MIRL, agents are assumed to follow strategies that constitute a correlated equilibrium while maximizing total game value. Problem uNE-MIRL is similar to uCE-MIRL in total game value maximization, but it is assumed that the agents are playing a Nash equilibrium. Problems advE-MIRL and cooE-MIRL assume agents are playing an adversarial equilibrium and a coordination equilibrium, respectively. We propose novel approaches to address these five problems under the assumption that the game observer either knows or is able to accurately estimate the policies and solution concepts for players. For uCS-MIRL, we first develop a characteristic set of solutions ensuring that the observed bi-policy is a uCS and then apply a Bayesian inverse learning method. For uCE-MIRL, we develop a linear programming problem subject to constraints that define necessary and sufficient conditions for the observed policies to be correlated equilibria. The objective is to choose a solution that not only minimizes the total game value difference between the observed bi-policy and a local uCS, but also maximizes the scale of the solution. We apply a similar treatment to the problem of uNE-MIRL. The remaining two problems can be solved efficiently by taking advantage of solution uniqueness and setting up a convex optimization problem.

To address this issue, we formulate the fair influence maximization problem concerning the trade-off between influence maximization and group fairness. For the purpose of solving the fair influence maximization problem in large-scale social networks efficiently, we propose a novel attribute-based reverse influence sampling (ABRIS) framework. This framework intends to estimate influence in specific groups with guarantee through an attribute-based hypergraph so that we can select seed nodes strategically. Therefore, under the ABRIS framework, we design two different node selection algorithms, ABRIS-G and ABRIS-T. ABRIS-G selects nodes in a greedy scheduling way. ABRIS-T adopts a two-phase node selection method. These algorithms run efficiently and achieve a good trade-off between influence maximization and group fairness.

Although focused reviews have been conducted on this topic, there is a lack of comprehensive work that details the core challenges of dialogue summarization, unifies the differing understanding of the task, and aligns proposed techniques, datasets, and evaluation metrics with the challenges. This article summarizes the research on Transformer-based abstractive summarization for English dialogues by systematically reviewing 1262 unique research papers published between 2019 and 2024, relying on the Semantic Scholar and DBLP databases. We cover the main challenges present in dialog summarization (i.e., language, structure, comprehension, speaker, salience, and factuality) and link them to corresponding techniques such as graph-based approaches, additional training tasks, and planning strategies, which typically overly rely on BART-based encoder-decoder models. Recent advances in training methods have led to substantial improvements in language-related challenges. However, challenges such as comprehension, factuality, and salience remain difficult and present significant research opportunities. We further investigate how these approaches are typically analyzed, covering the datasets for the subdomains of dialogue (e.g., meeting, customer service, and medical), the established automatic metrics (e.g., ROUGE), and common human evaluation approaches for assigning scores and evaluating annotator agreement. We observe that only a few datasets (i.e., SAMSum, AMI, DialogSum) are widely used. Despite its limitations, the ROUGE metric is the most commonly used, while human evaluation, considered the gold standard, is frequently reported without sufficient detail on the inter-annotator agreement and annotation guidelines.

To overcome this limitation, we introduce Proactive Dynamic DCOPs (PD-DCOPs), a novel formalism to model D-DCOPs in the presence of exogenous uncertainty.

Such disturbances are often modeled as process noise in a dynamical system, and common assumptions are that the underlying distributions are known and/or Gaussian. In practice, however, these assumptions may be unrealistic and can lead to poor approximations of the true noise distribution. We present a novel controller synthesis method that does not rely on any explicit representation of the noise distributions. In particular, we address the problem of computing a controller that provides probabilistic guarantees on safely reaching a target, while also avoiding unsafe regions of the state space. First, we abstract the continuous control system into a finite-state model that captures noise by probabilistic transitions between discrete states. As a key contribution, we adapt tools from the scenario approach to compute probably approximately correct (PAC) bounds on these transition probabilities, based on a finite number of samples of the noise. We capture these bounds in the transition probability intervals of a so-called interval Markov decision process (iMDP). This iMDP is, with a user-specified confidence probability, robust against uncertainty in the transition probabilities, and the tightness of the probability intervals can be controlled through the number of samples. We use state-of-the-art verification techniques to provide guarantees on the iMDP and compute a controller for which these guarantees carry over to the original control system. In addition, we develop a tailored computational scheme that reduces the complexity of the synthesis of these guarantees on the iMDP. Benchmarks on realistic control systems show the practical applicability of our method, even when the iMDP has hundreds of millions of transitions.", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/47eb6cf2bfc31faca36ba10efdb5efe00c8a57b5"}

Although this technology represents one of  the central objectives of AI and has been the focus of ever more intense research and  development efforts, it is currently limited to a few narrow domains (e.g., food ordering,  ticket booking) and a handful of languages (e.g., English, Chinese). This work provides an  extensive overview of existing methods and resources in multilingual ToD as an entry point  to this exciting and emerging field. We find that the most critical factor preventing the  creation of truly multilingual ToD systems is the lack of datasets in most languages for  both training and evaluation. In fact, acquiring annotations or human feedback for each  component of modular systems or for data-hungry end-to-end systems is expensive and  tedious. Hence, state-of-the-art approaches to multilingual ToD mostly rely on (zero- or  few-shot) cross-lingual transfer from resource-rich languages (almost exclusively English),  either by means of (i) machine translation or (ii) multilingual representations. These  approaches are currently viable only for typologically similar languages and languages with  parallel / monolingual corpora available. On the other hand, their effectiveness beyond these  boundaries is doubtful or hard to assess due to the lack of linguistically diverse benchmarks  (especially for natural language generation and end-to-end evaluation). To overcome this  limitation, we draw parallels between components of the ToD pipeline and other NLP tasks,  which can inspire solutions for learning in low-resource scenarios. Finally, we list additional  challenges that multilinguality poses for related areas (such as speech, fluency in generated  text, and human-centred evaluation), and indicate future directions that hold promise to  further expand language coverage and dialogue capabilities of current ToD systems. ", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d29036946152bddf950fec7a08c2828a8a8f902e"}

In HITL RL, human input is integrated during the agent’s learning process, allowing iterative updates and fine-tuning based on human feedback, thus enhancing the agent’s performance. Since the human is an essential part of this process, we argue that human-centric approaches are the key to successful RL, a fact that has not been adequately considered in the existing literature.

If alternative strategies need to be balanced, a data-driven approach can uncover insights that are not available from qualitative analysis. This could tremendously aid teams in their match preparations. In this work, we propose a novel Markov modelbased framework for soccer that allows reasoning about the specific strategies teams use in order to gain insights into the efficiency of each strategy. The framework consists of two components: (1) a learning component, which entails modeling a team’s offensive behavior by learning a Markov decision process (MDP) from event data that is collected from the team’s matches, and (2) a reasoning component, which involves a novel application of probabilistic model checking to reason about the efficacy of the learned strategies of each team. In this paper, we provide an overview of this framework and illustrate it on several use cases using real-world event data from three leagues. Our results show that the framework can be used to reason about the shot decision-making of teams and to optimise the defensive strategies used when playing against a particular team.

Our own recent work has identified iterative models, such as quantal cognitive hierarchy, as the state of the art for predicting human play in unrepeated, simultaneous-move games. Iterative models predict that agents reason iteratively about their opponents, building up from a specification of nonstrategic behavior called level-0. A modeler is in principle free to choose any description of level-0 behavior that makes sense for a given setting. However, in practice almost all existing work specifies this behavior as a uniform distribution over actions. In most games it is not plausible that even nonstrategic agents would choose an action uniformly at random, nor that other agents would expect them to do so. A more accurate model for level-0 behavior has the potential to dramatically improve predictions of human behavior, since a substantial fraction of agents may play level-0 strategies directly, and furthermore since iterative models ground all higher-level strategies in responses to the level-0 strategy. Our work considers models of the way in which level-0 agents construct a probability distribution over actions, given an arbitrary game. We considered a large space of alternatives and, in the end, recommend a model that achieved excellent performance across the board: a linear weighting of four binary features, each of which is general in the sense that it can be computed from any normal form game. Adding real-valued variants of the same four features yielded further improvements in performance, albeit with a corresponding increase in the number of parameters needing to be estimated. We evaluated the effects of combining these new level-0 models with several iterative models and observed large improvements in predictive accuracy.", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/514d43716681497751b71499ac29a2f4a61615f7"}

Linkage safety ensures that an anonymised dataset remains compliant even if it is linked to (possibly unknown) external datasets available on the Web, thus providing provable protection guarantees against data linkage attacks.

We operationalize the philosophical stance that “valuing is deliberatively consequential.” That is, if a participant’s choice is based on a deliberation of value preferences, the value preferences can be observed in the motivation the participant provides for the choice. Thus, we propose and compare value preferences estimation methods that prioritize the values estimated from motivations over the values estimated from choices alone. Then, we introduce a disambiguation strategy that combines Natural Language Processing and Active Learning to address the detected inconsistencies between choices and motivations. We evaluate the proposed methods on a dataset of a large-scale survey on energy transition.

Specifically, we study a scenario where EV charging is managed through self-interested EV aggregators who compete in the day-ahead market in order to purchase the electricity needed to meet their clients' requirements. With the aim of reducing electricity costs and lowering the impact on electricity markets, a centralised bidding coordination framework has been proposed in the literature employing a coordinator. In order to improve privacy and limit the need for the coordinator, we propose a reformulation of the coordination framework as a decentralised algorithm, employing the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). However, given the self-interested nature of the aggregators, they can deviate from the algorithm in order to reduce their energy costs. Hence, we study the strategic manipulation of the ADMM algorithm and, in doing so, describe and analyse different possible attack vectors and propose a mathematical framework to quantify and detect manipulation. Importantly, this detection framework is not limited to the considered EV scenario and can be applied to general ADMM algorithms. Finally, we test the proposed decentralised coordination and manipulation detection algorithms in realistic scenarios using real market and driver data from Spain. Our empirical results show that the decentralised algorithm's convergence to the optimal solution can be effectively disrupted by manipulative attacks achieving convergence to a different non-optimal solution which benefits the attacker.

A coloured MDP describes a collection of possible policy configurations with their structural dependencies. The framework covers the synthesis of (a) programmatic policies from probabilistic program sketches and (b) finite-state controllers representing policies for partially observable MDPs (POMDPs), including decentralised POMDPs as well as constrained POMDPs. We show that all these synthesis problems can be cast as exploring memoryless policies in the corresponding coloured MDP.

In contrast, we introduce MA-LAMA, a multi-agent temporal planner that makes use of multi-agent techniques to deal with the inherent complexity of multi-agent temporal scenarios.\nMethods: We propose a sequenced framework in which several multi-agent planning techniques are applied: automatic agent detection, task decomposition, cost-informed goal assignment, and agent interaction analysis; that are aimed to reduce the search complexity when solving temporal planning tasks.\nResults: Our results show that, in many cases, MA-LAMA outperforms other state-of-the-art temporal planners in plan cost optimization for well-known temporal domains.\nConclusions: These results, along with the fact that MA-LAMA does not incorporate any temporal reasoning during search, suggest that several widely considered temporal domains are best suited to be solved with multi-agent planning techniques, rather than with temporal reasoning.", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/37e36540ab7a296b21f467b676dfcd5e53ad32a5"}

In this paper, we study popularity, strong popularity, and mixed popularity (which is particularly attractive because existence is guaranteed by the Minimax Theorem) in a variety of coalition formation settings. Extending previous work on marriage games, we show that mixed popular partitions in roommate games can be found efficiently via linear programming and a separation oracle. This approach is quite universal, leading to efficient algorithms for verifying whether a given partition is popular and for finding strongly popular partitions (resolving an open problem). By contrast, we prove that both problems become computationally intractable when moving from coalitions of size 2 to coalitions of size 3, even when preferences are strict and globally ranked. Moreover, we show that finding popular, strongly popular, and mixed popular partitions in symmetric additively separable hedonic games and symmetric fractional hedonic games is NP-hard.

Reinforcement learning is expensive to train and often struggles to achieve coordination among a large fleet. This paper designs a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of the two while overcoming their drawbacks. Specifically, it trains an optimization proxy, i.e., a machine-learning model that approximates an optimization model, and then refines the proxy with reinforcement learning. This Reinforcement Learning from Optimization Proxy (RLOP) approach is computationally efficient to train and deploy, and achieves better results than RL or optimization alone. Numerical experiments on the New York City dataset show that the RLOP approach reduces both the relocation costs and computation time significantly compared to the optimization model, while pure reinforcement learning fails to converge due to computational complexity.\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a308a2c9c55321abab071444c16f12c8dde5d7cc"}

In many applications such as autonomous driving, failures cannot be completely eliminated due to the complex stochastic environment in which the system operates. As a result, safety validation is not only concerned about whether a failure can occur, but also discovering which failures are most likely to occur. This article presents adaptive stress testing (AST), a framework for finding the most likely path to a failure event in simulation. We consider a general black box setting for partially observable and continuous-valued systems operating in an environment with stochastic disturbances. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and use reinforcement learning to optimize it. The approach is simulation-based and does not require internal knowledge of the system, making it suitable for black-box testing of large systems. We present different formulations depending on whether the state is fully observable or partially observable. In the latter case, we present a modified Monte Carlo tree search algorithm that only requires access to the pseudorandom number generator of the simulator to overcome partial observability. We also present an extension of the framework, called differential adaptive stress testing (DAST), that can find failures that occur in one system but not in another. This type of differential analysis is useful in applications such as regression testing, where we are concerned with finding areas of relative weakness compared to a baseline. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on an aircraft collision avoidance application, where a prototype aircraft collision avoidance system is stress tested to find the most likely scenarios of near mid-air collision. \n \n \n", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/65b00ea70ae48c0d61e18de045861c43d2e26b73"}

This is the first SMT encoding that can handle the whole set of PDDL+ features (including processes and events), and is implemented in the planner SMTPlan. SMTPlan not only covers the full semantics of PDDL+, but can also deal with non-linear polynomial continuous change without discretization. This allows it to generate plans with non-linear dynamics that are correct-by-construction. The encoding is based on the notion of happenings, and can be applied on domains with nonlinear continuous change. We describe the encoding in detail and provide in-depth examples. We apply this encoding in an iterative deepening planning algorithm. Experimental results show that the approach dramatically outperforms existing work in finding plans for PDDL+ problems. We also present experiments which explore the performance of the proposed approach on temporal planning problems, showing that the scalability of the approach is limited by the size of the discrete search space.

In this paper, we propose an algorithm, namely Sliding-Window Thompson Sampling (SW-TS), for nonstationary stochastic MAB settings. Our algorithm is based on Thompson Sampling and exploits a sliding-window approach to tackle, in a unified fashion, two different forms of non-stationarity studied separately so far: abruptly changing and smoothly changing. In the former, the reward distributions are constant during sequences of rounds, and their change may be arbitrary and happen at unknown rounds, while, in the latter, the reward distributions smoothly evolve over rounds according to unknown dynamics. Under mild assumptions, we provide regret upper bounds on the dynamic pseudo-regret of SW-TS for the abruptly changing environment, for the smoothly changing one, and for the setting in which both the non-stationarity forms are present.

Whether real or not, the belief in such a race for domain supremacy through AI, can make it real simply from its consequences, as put forward by the Thomas theorem. These consequences may be negative, as racing for technological supremacy creates a complex ecology of choices that could push stake-holders to underestimate or even ignore ethical and safety procedures. As a consequence, different actors are urging to consider both the normative and social impact of these technological advancements, contemplating the use of the precautionary principle in AI innovation and research. Yet, given the breadth and depth of AI and its advances, it is difficult to assess which technology needs regulation and when. As there is no easy access to data describing this alleged AI race, theoretical models are necessary to understand its potential dynamics, allowing for the identification of when procedures need to be put in place to favour outcomes beneficial for all. We show that, next to the risks of setbacks and being reprimanded for unsafe behaviour, the time-scale in which domain supremacy can be achieved plays a crucial role. When this can be achieved in a short term, those who completely ignore the safety precautions are bound to win the race but at a cost to society, apparently requiring regulatory actions. Our analysis reveals that imposing regulations for all risk and timing conditions may not have the anticipated effect as only for specific conditions a dilemma arises between what is individually preferred and globally beneficial. Similar observations can be made for the long-term development case. Yet different from the short-term situation, conditions can be identified that require the promotion of risk-taking as opposed to compliance with safety regulations in order to improve social welfare. These results remain robust both when two or several actors are involved in the race and when collective rather than individual setbacks are produced by risk-taking behaviour. When defining codes of conduct and regulatory policies for applications of AI, a clear understanding of the time-scale of the race is thus required, as this may induce important non-trivial effects. \n \n \nThis article is part of the special track on AI and Society. \n \n \n ", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0219bae246876965f62f0dca64a40d09c4a88c01"}

Instead, the (downside) semivariance, which captures the negative deviation of a random variable under its mean, is more suitable for risk-averse proposes. This paper aims at optimizing the mean-semivariance (MSV) criterion in reinforcement learning w.r.t. steady rewards. Since semivariance is time-inconsistent and does not satisfy the standard Bellman equation, the traditional dynamic programming methods are inapplicable to MSV problems directly. To tackle this challenge, we resort to the Perturbation Analysis (PA) theory and establish the performance difference formula for MSV. We reveal that the MSV problem can be solved by iteratively solving a sequence of RL problems with a policy-dependent reward function.

This complexity stems from the diversity and innovativeness of social media texts, which include unique expressions and special sentence structures.

This issue is compounded by the scant research on Chinese texts, leading to inefficiencies in recognition accuracy. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce an innovative framework based on a Global Contrastive Semantic Network (GCSN), designed to enhance malicious text recognition efficiency and accuracy by deeply learning global semantic knowledge. It comprises an encoder for global semantic information modelling and a graph-matching network for semantic similarity evaluation between question pairs, enabling the accurate identification and filtering of malicious texts with complex structures. Furthermore, we introduce a semantic consistency-based data augmentation method (COMBINE), using real-world data to generate balanced positive and negative samples, enriching the dataset and enhancing the model's ability to distinguish semantic consistency through contrastive learning.

These games are defined relative to a finite set of resources and the strategy set of each player corresponds to a set of subsets of resources. The cost of a resource is an arbitrary function of the load vector of a certain subset of resources. As our main result, we give complete characterizations of the cost functions guaranteeing the existence of pure Nash equilibria for weighted and unweighted players, respectively. \nFor unweighted players, pure Nash equilibria are guaranteed to exist for any choice of the players’ strategy space if and only if the cost of each resource is an arbitrary function of the load of the resource itself and linear in the load of all other resources where the linear coefficients of mutual influence of different resources are symmetric. This implies in particular that for any other cost structure there is a resource graph game that does not have a pure Nash equilibrium. \nFor weighted games where players have intrinsic weights and the cost of each resource depends on the aggregated weight of its users, pure Nash equilibria are guaranteed to exist if and only if the cost of a resource is linear in all resource loads, and the linear factors of mutual influence are symmetric, or there is no interaction among resources and the cost is an exponential function of the local resource load. \nWe further discuss the computational complexity of pure Nash equilibria in resource graph games showing that for unweighted games where pure Nash equilibria are guaranteed to exist, it is coNP-complete to decide for a given strategy profile whether it is a pure Nash equilibrium.

Previous works for POI recommendation usually use matrix factorization (MF)-based methods, which achieve promising performance. However, existing MF-based methods suffer from two critical limitations: (1) Privacy issues: all users’ sensitive data are collected to the centralized server which may leak on either the server side or during transmission. (2) Poor resource utilization and training efficiency: training on centralized server with potentially huge low-rank matrices is computational inefficient. In this paper, we propose a novel decentralized gradient-quantization based matrix factorization (DGMF) framework to address the above limitations in POI recommendation. Compared with the centralized MF methods which store all sensitive data and low-rank matrices during model training, DGMF treats each user’s device (e.g., phone) as an independent learner and keeps the sensitive data on each user’s end. Furthermore, a privacy-preserving and communication-efficient mechanism with gradient-quantization technique is presented to train the proposed model, which aims to handle the privacy problem and reduces the communication cost in the decentralized setting.

To enable this, the Bayesian networks are transformed into Markov chains and their objectives are mapped onto probabilistic temporal logic formulas. \nFor exact inference, we compare probabilistic model checking to weighted model counting on various Bayesian network benchmarks.

It is used in many settings, such as school choice, course allocations and residency matches. Without having any information on the underlying cardinal utilities, arguing about the fairness of allocations requires extending the ordinal item ranking to ordinal bundle ranking. The most commonly used such extension is stochastic dominance (SD), where a bundle X is preferred over a bundle Y if its score is better according to all additive score functions. SD is a very conservative extension, by which few allocations are necessarily fair while many allocations are possibly fair. We propose to make a natural assumption on the underlying cardinal utilities of the players, namely that the difference between two items at the top is larger than the difference between two items at the bottom. This assumption implies a preference extension which we call diminishing differences (DD), where X is preferred over Y if its score is better according to all additive score functions satisfying the DD assumption. We give a full characterization of allocations that are necessarily-proportional or possibly-proportional according to this assumption. Based on this characterization, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for finding a necessarily-DD-proportional allocation whenever it exists. Using simulations, we compare the various fairness criteria in terms of their probability of existence, and their probability of being fair by the underlying cardinal valuations. We find that necessary-DD-proportionality fares well in both measures.

A typical approach to obtain the optimal policies is to first construct a loss function based on the scalarization of individual objectives and then derive optimal policies that minimize the scalarized loss function. Albeit simple and efficient, the typical approach provides no insights/mechanisms on the optimization of multiple objectives due to the lack of ability to quantify the inter-objective relationship. To address the issue, we propose to develop a new efficient gradient-based multi-objective reinforcement learning approach that seeks to iteratively uncover the quantitative inter-objective relationship via finding a minimum-norm point in the convex hull of the set of multiple policy gradients when the impact of one objective on others is unknown a priori. In particular, we first propose a new PAOLS algorithm that integrates pruning and approximate optimistic linear support algorithm to efficiently discover the weight-vector sets of multiple gradients that quantify the inter-objective relationship. Then we construct an actor and a multi-objective critic that can co-learn the policy and the multi-objective vector value function. Finally, the weight discovery process and the policy and vector value function learning process can be iteratively executed to yield stable weight-vector sets and policies.

However, its performance is not uniform on all domains, and it also depends on how parameters that control the search are set. Parameter values that are optimal for a task might be sub-optimal for another. In a domain that tackles many games with different characteristics, like general game playing (GGP), selecting appropriate parameter settings is not a trivial task. Games are unknown to the player, thus, finding optimal parameters for a given game in advance is not feasible. Previous work has looked into tuning parameter values online, while the game is being played, showing some promising results. This tuning approach looks for optimal parameter values, balancing exploitation of values that performed well so far in the search and exploration of less sampled values. Continuously changing parameter values while performing the search, combined also with exploration of multiple values, introduces some randomization in the process. In addition, previous research indicates that adding randomization to certain components of MCTS might increase the diversification of the search and improve the performance. Therefore, this article investigates the effect of randomly selecting values for MCTS search-control parameters online among predefined sets of reasonable values. For the GGP domain, this article evaluates four different online parameter randomization strategies by comparing them with other methods to set parameter values: online parameter tuning, offline parameter tuning and sub-optimal parameter choices. Results on a set of 14 heterogeneous abstract games show that randomizing parameter values before each simulation has a positive effect on the search in some of the tested games, with respect to using fixed offline-tuned parameters. Moreover, results show a clear distinction between games for which online parameter tuning works best and games for which online randomization works best. In addition, the overall performance of online parameter randomization is closer to the one of online parameter turning than the one of sub-optimal parameter values, showing that online randomization is a reasonable parameter selection strategy. When analyzing the structure of the search trees generated by agents that use the different parameters selection strategies, it is clear that randomization causes MCTS to become more explorative, which is helpful for alignment games that present many winning paths in their trees. Online parameter tuning, instead, seems more suitable for games that present narrow winning paths and many losing paths.", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bf11ff603026c28521c1a657e97c0364727915b0"}

We find that, for several semantics, the decompositionbased version coincides with the original semantics, whereas for others, it gives rise to a new semantics. These new semantics allow us to deal with pertinent problems such as odd-length negative cycles in a more general setting, that for instance also encompasses logic programs. We perform an exhaustive analysis of the computational complexity of these new, so-called naive-based semantics. The results are quite interesting, for some of them involve little-known classes of the so-called Boolean hierarchy (another hierarchy in between classes of the polynomial hierarchy).

Prior works in Chinese parsing have struggled with whether to de ne words when modeling character interactions. We choose to integrate full character-level syntactic dependency relationships using neural representations from character embeddings and richer linguistic syntactic information from human-annotated character-level Parts-Of-Speech and dependency labels. This has the potential to better understand the deeper structure of Chinese sentences and provides a better structural formalism for avoiding unnecessary structural ambiguities. Specifically, we  first compare two different character-level syntax annotation styles: constituency and dependency. Then, we discuss two key problems for character-level parsing: (1) how to combine constituent and dependency syntactic structure in full character-level trees and (2) how to convert from character-level to word-level for both constituent and dependency trees. In addition, we also explore several other key parsing aspects, including di erent character-level dependency annotations and joint learning of Parts-Of-Speech and syntactic parsing.

Machine learning methods typically train recurrent neural networks (RNN) as effective representations of POMDP policies that can efficiently process sequential data. However, it is hard to verify whether the POMDP driven by such RNN-based policies satisfies safety constraints, for instance, given by temporal logic specifications. We propose a novel method that combines techniques from machine learning with the field of formal methods: training an RNN-based policy and then automatically extracting a so-called finite-state controller (FSC) from the RNN. Such FSCs offer a convenient way to verify temporal logic constraints. Implemented on a POMDP, they induce a Markov chain, and probabilistic verification methods can efficiently check whether this induced Markov chain satisfies a temporal logic specification. Using such methods, if the Markov chain does not satisfy the specification, a byproduct of verification is diagnostic information about the states in the POMDP that are critical for the specification. The method exploits this diagnostic information to either adjust the complexity of the extracted FSC or improve the policy by performing focused retraining of the RNN. The method synthesizes policies that satisfy temporal logic specifications for POMDPs with up to millions of states, which are three orders of magnitude larger than comparable approaches.", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/845a23b404679361d30720d60030494b6783dbe1"}

It is a common misunderstanding that closed-form inverse kinematics analysis is solved. Popular software and algorithms, such as gradient descent or any multi-variant equations solving algorithm, claims solving inverse kinematics but only on the numerical level. While the numerical inverse kinematics solutions are relatively straightforward to obtain, these methods often fail, due to dependency on specific numerical values, even when the inverse kinematics solutions exist. Therefore, closed-form inverse kinematics analysis is superior, but there is no generalized automated algorithm. Up till now, the high-level logical reasoning involved in solving closed-form inverse kinematics made it hard to automate, so it's handled by human experts. We developed IKBT, a knowledge-based intelligent system that can mimic human experts' behaviors in solving closed-from inverse kinematics using Behavior Tree. Knowledge and rules used by engineers when solving closed-from inverse kinematics are encoded as actions in Behavior Tree. The order of applying these rules is governed by higher level composite nodes, which resembles the logical reasoning process of engineers. It is also the first time that the dependency of joint variables, an important issue in inverse kinematics analysis, is automatically tracked in graph form. Besides generating closed-form solutions, IKBT also explains its solving strategies in human (engineers) interpretable form.

Planning in such scenarios is challenging, especially in the context of Multi-Agent Pathfinding (MAPF), where the goal is to find paths to multiple agents and temporal coordination is necessary to avoid collisions. In this work, we consider a MAPF problem with this form of time uncertainty, where we are only given upper and lower bounds on the time it takes each agent to move. The objective is to find a safe solution, which is a solution that can be executed by all agents and is guaranteed to avoid collisions. We propose two complete and optimal algorithms for finding safe solutions based on well-known MAPF algorithms, namely, A* with Operator Decomposition (A* + OD) and Conflict-Based Search (CBS). Experimentally, we observe that on several standard MAPF grids the CBS-based algorithm performs better. We also explore the option of online replanning in this context, i.e., modifying the agents' plans during execution, to reduce the overall execution cost. We consider two online settings: (a) when an agent can sense the current time and its current location, and (b) when the agents can also communicate seamlessly during execution.

However, the existing literature primarily focuses on the quality of synthetic health data, neglecting the crucial aspect of fairness in downstream predictions. Consequently, models trained on synthetic EHR have faced criticism for producing biased outcomes in target tasks. These biases can arise from either spurious correlations between features or the failure of models to accurately represent sub-groups. To address these concerns, we present Bias-transforming Generative Adversarial Networks (Bt-GAN), a GAN-based synthetic data generator specifically designed for the healthcare domain. In order to tackle spurious correlations (i), we propose an information-constrained Data Generation Process (DGP) that enables the generator to learn a fair deterministic transformation based on a well-defined notion of algorithmic fairness. To overcome the challenge of capturing exact sub-group representations (ii), we incentivize the generator to preserve sub-group densities through score-based weighted sampling. This approach compels the generator to learn from underrepresented regions of the data manifold. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database. Our results demonstrate that Bt-GAN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while significantly improving fairness and minimizing bias amplification. Furthermore, we perform an in-depth explainability analysis to provide additional evidence supporting the validity of our study.

Furthermore, since the amount of dialogs in the DialogBank is small, we rely on transfer learning processes to reduce overfitting and improve performance.

Algorithms for classical planning are domain-independent, i.e., they are not limited to a particular application and instead can be used to solve different types of reasoning problems. The main language for modeling such problems is the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). Even though it provides many language features for expressing a wide range of planning tasks, most of today’s classical planners, especially optimal ones, support only a small subset of its features. The most widely supported fragment is lifted STRIPS plus types and action costs. While this fragment suffices to model some interesting planning tasks, using it to model more realistic problems often incurs a much higher modeling effort. Even if modeling is possible at all, solving the resulting tasks is often infeasible in practice, as the required encoding size increases exponentially.\nTo address these issues, we show how to support more expressive modeling languages natively in optimal classical planning algorithms. Specifically, we focus on symbolic search, a state-of-the-art search algorithm that operates on sets of world states. We show how to extend symbolic search to support classical planning with conditional effects, axioms, and state-dependent action costs. All of these modeling features are expressive in the sense that compiling them away incurs a significant blow-up, so is it often necessary to support them natively. Except for blind (non-symbolic) search, our new symbolic search is the first optimal classical planning algorithm that supports these three modeling extensions in combination, and it even compares favorably to other state-of-the-art approaches that only support a subset of the extensions.", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0e5ac341ae01823d9939c63d6416ff27bd399580"}

Our approach utilizes the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to propose effective streamliners for problems specified in the MiniZinc constraint programming language and integrates feedback to the LLM with quick empirical tests for validation. Evaluated across seven diverse constraint satisfaction problems, our method achieves substantial runtime reductions. We compare the results to obfuscated and disguised variants of the problem to see whether the results depend on LLM memorization. We also analyze whether longer offline runs improve the quality of streamliners and whether the LLM can propose good combinations of streamliners.", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e0808607b4ae549996186787b2b19203ef4e5f60"}

We demonstrate an NP-hardness result, with the hardness stemming from the dynamically changing distributions of the travel time random variables.

Our focus is on explaining X rather than (re)generating it. We present applications in knowledge discovery, using ILL to distill music theory from scores and chemical laws from molecules and further revealing connections between them.

By directly estimating the likelihood of data, our model moves beyond approximating expected behaviour with a single point estimate, as is the case in reconstruction error models.

However, decisions derived from ML models can reproduce, amplify, or even introduce unfairness in our societies, causing harm to (groups of) individuals. In response, researchers have started to propose AutoML systems that jointly optimize fairness and predictive performance to mitigate fairness-related harm. However, fairness is a complex and inherently interdisciplinary subject, and solely posing it as an optimization problem can have adverse side effects. With this work, we aim to raise awareness among developers of AutoML systems about such limitations of fairness-aware AutoML, while also calling attention to the potential of AutoML as a tool for fairness research. We present a comprehensive overview of different ways in which fairness-related harm can arise and the ensuing implications for the design of fairness-aware AutoML.

However, the current landscape of DA in TSC is plagued with fragmented literature reviews, nebulous methodological taxonomies, inadequate evaluative measures, and a dearth of accessible and user-oriented tools.\nObjectives: This study addresses these challenges through a comprehensive examination of DA methodologies within the TSC domain.\nMethods: Our research began with an extensive literature review spanning a decade, revealing significant gaps in existing surveys and necessitating a detailed analysis of over 100 scholarly articles to identify more than 60 distinct DA techniques. This rigorous review led to the development of a novel taxonomy tailored to the specific needs of DA in TSC, categorizing techniques into five primary categories to guide researchers in selecting appropriate methods with greater clarity. In response to the lack of comprehensive evaluations of foundational DA techniques, we conducted a thorough empirical study, testing nearly 20 DA strategies across 15 diverse datasets representing all types within the UCR time-series repository. To improve practical use, we have consolidated most of these methods into a unified Python Library, whose user-friendly interface facilitates experimenting with various augmentation techniques, offering practitioners and researchers a more convenient tool for innovation than currently available options.\nResults: Using ResNet and LSTM architectures, we employed a multifaceted evaluation approach, including metrics such as Accuracy, Method Ranking, and Residual Analysis, resulting in a benchmark accuracy of 84.98 ± 16.41% in ResNet and 82.41 ± 18.71% in LSTM. Our investigation underscored the inconsistent efficacies of DA techniques, for instance, methods like RGWs (with an average rank of 7.13 and average accuracy of 83.42 ± 17.53% in LSTM) and Random Permutation significantly improved model performance, whereas others, like EMD, were less effective. Furthermore, we found that the intrinsic characteristics of datasets significantly influence the success of DA methods, leading to targeted recommendations based on empirical evidence to help practitioners select the most suitable DA techniques for specific datasets.\nConclusions: In essence, this research presents an integrative perspective on the contemporary landscape of data augmentation for time series classification, combining theoretical frameworks with empirical evidence. The revelations and resources introduced herein are positioned to catalyze continued progress in this domain, fortifying machine learning models against the challenges posed by data limitations, and enhancing their generalizability and robustness.", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/86b492132c5b9e9844d11ef9f27b0432fa20ad3f"}

State space search is a basic method for conducting such an analysis. A wealth of techniques have been proposed to reduce the search space without affecting the existence of (optimal) solution paths. In particular, strong stubborn set (SSS) pruning is a prominent such method, analyzing action dependencies to prune commutative parts of the search space. We herein show how to apply this idea to star-topology decoupled state space search, a recent search reformulation method invented in the context of classical AI planning. \nStar-topology decoupled state space search, short decoupled search, addresses planning tasks where a single center component interacts with several leaf components. The search exploits a form of conditional independence arising in this setting: given a fixed path p of transitions by the center, the possible leaf moves compliant with p are independent across the leaves. Decoupled search thus searches over center paths only, maintaining the compliant paths for each leaf separately. This avoids the enumeration of combined states across leaves. \nJust like standard search, decoupled search is adversely affected by commutative parts of its search space. The adaptation of strong stubborn set pruning is challenging due to the more complex structure of the search space, and the resulting ways in which action dependencies may affect the search. We spell out how to address this challenge, designing optimality-preserving decoupled strong stubborn set (DSSS) pruning methods. We introduce a design for star topologies in full generality, as well as simpler design variants for the practically relevant fork and inverted fork special cases. We show that there are cases where DSSS pruning is exponentially more effective than both, decoupled search and SSS pruning, exhibiting true synergy where the whole is more than the sum of its parts. Empirically, DSSS pruning reliably inherits the best of its components, and sometimes outperforms both.", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f47d9b48d0648313cfc72a7b2fad806e489e7db4"}

We here attempt to formalise ways to judge goodness of such explanations in terms of their correctness. For assessing correctness, one needs to have desirable properties of explanation correctness in mind, as well as was to measure satisfaction of those properties. We submit two high-level properties of soundness and completeness for assessing explanation correctness: explaining is sound if the model behaves the way the explanations say; explaining is complete if explanations can be given for model’s outputs on any inputs. We formulate soundness and completeness properties for three forms of explanations: feature importance, counterfactuals and rules. We further formalise multiple general metrics, at least one for each property and form of explanation, for quantitatively measuring satisfaction of soundness and completeness. We argue that explanations are correct in as much as various aspects of the different forms of explanations are met as quantified by those metrics.

Most pedestrian–vehicle interaction models are not suitable for predicting individual trajectories. Data-driven models yield accurate predictions but lack generalizability to new scenarios, usually do not run in real time and produce results that are poorly explainable. Current expert models do not deal with the diversity of possible pedestrian interactions with the vehicle in a shared space and lack microscopic validation. We propose an expert pedestrian model that combines the social force model and a new decision model for anticipating pedestrian–vehicle interactions. The proposed model integrates different observed pedestrian behaviors, as well as the behaviors of the social groups of pedestrians, in diverse interaction scenarios with a car. We calibrate the model by fitting the parameters values on a training set. We validate the model and evaluate its predictive potential through qualitative and quantitative comparisons with ground truth trajectories. The proposed model reproduces observed behaviors that have not been replicated by the social force model and outperforms the social force model at predicting pedestrian behavior around the vehicle on the used dataset. The model generates explainable and real-time trajectory predictions. Additional evaluation on a new dataset shows that the model generalizes well to new scenarios and can be applied to an autonomous vehicle embedded prediction.", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c6b18acce1d8844973b644a3d760e29dfacbf2eb"}

Most real-world autonomous driving pipelines perform perception, motion planning and action in a loop. In this work we present MADRaS, an open-source multi-agent driving simulator for use in the design and evaluation of motion planning algorithms for autonomous driving. Given a start and a goal state, the task of motion planning is to solve for a sequence of position, orientation and speed values in order to navigate between the states while adhering to safety constraints. These constraints often involve the behaviors of other agents in the environment. MADRaS provides a platform for constructing a wide variety of highway and track driving scenarios where multiple driving agents can be trained for motion planning tasks using reinforcement learning and other machine learning algorithms. MADRaS is built on TORCS, an open-source car-racing simulator. TORCS offers a variety of cars with different dynamic properties and driving tracks with different geometries and surface.  MADRaS inherits these functionalities from TORCS and introduces support for multi-agent training, inter-vehicular communication, noisy observations, stochastic actions, and custom traffic cars whose behaviors can be programmed to simulate challenging traffic conditions encountered in the real world. MADRaS can be used to create driving tasks whose complexities can be tuned along eight axes in well-defined steps. This makes it particularly suited for curriculum and continual learning. MADRaS is lightweight and it provides a convenient OpenAI Gym interface for independent control of each car. Apart from the primitive steering-acceleration-brake control mode of TORCS, MADRaS offers a hierarchical track-position – speed control mode that can potentially be used to achieve better generalization. MADRaS uses a UDP based client server model where the simulation engine is the server and each client is a driving agent. MADRaS uses multiprocessing to run each agent as a parallel process for efficiency and integrates well with popular reinforcement learning libraries like RLLib.

But to date, it is not clear how to delineate the space of options for measures, nor is it clear how we can classify measures systematically. To address these problems, we introduce a general framework for comparing syntactic measures of inconsistency. It is based on the notion of an inconsistency graph for each knowledgebase (a bipartite graph with a set of vertices representing formulas in the knowledgebase, a set of vertices representing minimal inconsistent subsets of the knowledgebase, and edges representing that a formula belongs to a minimal inconsistent subset). We then show that various measures can be computed using the inconsistency graph.
